        <h3>Personal Opinons</h3>
    </header>
    <body> 
        <p> My personal opinions on the Thunder are more positive then it is negative. The Thunder have been a dominant force in the league for years, but that changed this offseason. This offseason them losing their star backcourt: Russel Westbrook and Paul George. With a couple other changs to the team, they officialy declared themselves in rebuild mode, or where they try to get themselves the next big stars. A team does this by gaining a lot of picks, which the Thunder have. As a Thunder Fan I am fine with this as the team has had it's chance to win countless times, and our team just didn't cut it. My hopes are that this franchise will become legendary, and win countless championships with that title.</p>
